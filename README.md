# FerrumForge ðŸ”—

A comprehensive blockchain simulator with proof-of-work mining, built in Rust for educational purposes.

## Features

- **Basic Blockchain**: Create blocks, manage chains, validate integrity
- **Proof-of-Work Mining**: Mine blocks with adjustable difficulty
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Automatic difficulty adjustment based on block timing
- **Serialization**: Save and load blockchain state (JSON/Binary)
- **CLI Interface**: Easy-to-use command-line interface
- **Performance Monitoring**: Mining statistics and hash rate tracking

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ (install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/))

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ferrumforge
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Create a new block with data
ferrumforge create-block "Hello, Blockchain!"

# Mine a block with proof-of-work
ferrumforge mine-block "Mined block data"

# Validate the entire blockchain
ferrumforge validate-chain

# Show the current blockchain
ferrumforge show-chain

# Display blockchain statistics
ferrumforge chain-stats

# Set mining difficulty (number of leading zeros)
ferrumforge set-difficulty 4

# Export blockchain to file
ferrumforge export-chain blockchain.json

# Import blockchain from file
ferrumforge import-chain blockchain.json
```

### Examples

```bash
# Start with a simple block
ferrumforge create-block "Genesis transaction"

# Mine some blocks with increasing difficulty
ferrumforge set-difficulty 2
ferrumforge mine-block "First mined block"

ferrumforge set-difficulty 3
ferrumforge mine-block "Second mined block"

# Check the results
ferrumforge show-chain
ferrumforge chain-stats
```
